This package should look like Unitful.jl but behave like DynamicQuantities.jl under the hood

Tasks:
1. Resolve some design decisions:
    -  In math, attempt to remove "Number" from functions that apply to matrices (try to use "Any" instead)
    -  Find a workable solution to the "zero" problem for dynamic units
        -  You can't infer the dimension with just the dimension type, we need a placeholder for a "free agent dimension"
            -  This "free agent" should probably AbstractDimensions{Missing}
            -  Union{Missing, Number} is a natural promotion type
                -  Multiplcation operations would get nullified which is exactly what "zero" does
            -  `$quantity + $free_agent_zero` should return the original `$quantity`
2. Build out documentation and a docs badge
    -  Include all-stops-out tutorial on defining a new dimension "RadDims"
    -  Add angle to the dimension list
    -  Create a new unit registry with that dimension 
    -  Re-tool sin, cos, tan rules on this particular dimension
3. Add "unit_info(u::Union{Dimension, AbstractUnit{Dimension}})" 
    - Maps dimensions to a meaning (like Force or Inductance) and lists other units of that dimension
    - This can be done without documentation 
        - Use Dict{Dimension,String} to find dimension "meaning" (determine this by unique dimensions)
        - Iterate over registry and list other units that match the query dimension
4. Announce the package
5. Consier supporting ArrayQuantity (can use some Quantity methods as fallbacks)


import DynamicQuantities
import Unitful
using BenchmarkTools

v1flex = ubase.([1u"m/s", 1u"J/kg", 1u"A/V"])
v1uni  = [1*Unitful.u"m/s", 1*Unitful.u"J/kg", 1*Unitful.u"A/V"]
v1dyn  = [1*DynamicQuantities.u"m/s", 1*DynamicQuantities.u"J/kg", 1*DynamicQuantities.u"A/V"]

@btime sum(x->x^0.0, v1uni)
@btime sum(x->x^0.0, v1flex)
@btime sum(x->x^0.0, v1dyn)

t1flex = ubase.((1u"m/s", 1u"J/kg", 1u"A/V"))
t1uni  = (1*Unitful.u"m/s", 1*Unitful.u"J/kg", 1*Unitful.u"A/V")
t1dyn  = (1*DynamicQuantities.u"m/s", 1*DynamicQuantities.u"J/kg", 1*DynamicQuantities.u"A/V")

@btime sum(x->x^0, t1uni)
@btime sum(x->x^0, t1flex)
@btime sum(x->x^0, t1dyn)

Considerations:
N.  Consider commutative macro for promote_rule to prevent repetition
